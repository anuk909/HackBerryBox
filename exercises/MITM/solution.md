# Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Exercise Solution

## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks can be performed and how to prevent them.

## Exploitation
1. Access the victim application at `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Use the attacker application at `http://localhost:5001` to intercept and modify messages.
3. Run the `attacker.py` script to:
   - Retrieve messages from the victim application
   - Display intercepted messages
   - Allow modification of selected messages
   - Send modified messages back to the victim application

## Explanation
The MITM attack is possible because:
1. The communication between the victim and the server is unencrypted (HTTP).
2. There's no authentication mechanism to verify the integrity of messages.
3. The attacker can easily position themselves between the victim and the server.

## Prevention
To prevent MITM attacks, implement the following measures:

1. Use HTTPS:
   - Configure the server to use HTTPS, ensuring all communication is encrypted.
   - Example in Flask:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask
     from flask_talisman import Talisman

     app = Flask(__name__)
     Talisman(app, force_https=True)
     ```

2. Implement Strong Authentication:
   - Use protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure authentication.
   - Example using Flask-JWT:
     ```python
     from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required

     app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'
     jwt = JWTManager(app)

     @app.route('/protected')
     @jwt_required
     def protected():
         return jsonify({"status": "success"})
     ```

3. Use Secure Protocols:
   - Prefer secure protocols like SSH for data transfer instead of unencrypted protocols.

4. Certificate Pinning:
   - Implement certificate pinning to prevent attackers from using fake certificates.

5. Network Segmentation:
   - Use VLANs or network segmentation to isolate sensitive communications.

## Additional Prevention Measures
1. Regular security audits and penetration testing.
2. Keep all software and libraries up-to-date.
3. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor for suspicious activities.
4. Educate users about the risks of connecting to unsecured networks.

## Conclusion
This exercise demonstrates the dangers of unencrypted communication and the importance of implementing proper security measures. Always use HTTPS, implement strong authentication, and regularly update your security practices to protect against MITM attacks.
