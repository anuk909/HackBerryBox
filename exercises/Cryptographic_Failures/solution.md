# Cryptographic Failures - Solution

## Overview
This exercise demonstrates a common cryptographic failure vulnerability. The goal is to exploit weak encryption to retrieve sensitive information.

## Steps to Exploit
1. Access the web application and identify the encrypted data.
2. Use a tool like John the Ripper to perform a brute-force attack on the encrypted data.
3. Retrieve the decrypted information.

## Explanation
The application uses weak encryption algorithms or improper key management, allowing attackers to decrypt sensitive information.

## Mitigation
To fix this vulnerability, use strong encryption algorithms and proper key management practices.
